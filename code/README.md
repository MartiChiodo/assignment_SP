The purpose of this code is to solve an optimization problem which integrates three critical points in healthcare, surgical case planning, patient admission scheduling and nurse-to-room assignment, by applying the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure. The problem is better presented at [ntegrated Healthcare Timetabling Competition 2024](https://ihtc2024.github.io/) site.

The code is structured on three main blocks: the first one is contained in the folder 'istances' and contains the definitions of the classes we need to store data, the second one concerns the implementation of the solvers and the third is the main.py script in which starting from a given dataset, we initialize the needed classes and we attemp to solve the optimization problem by using the implemented GRASP. Said that, the code can be run from the main.py script after having specified in the code the dataset we want to use. In the folder 'data' are contained some datasets along with their solution which could be used to test the program.

Even if the aim of this code is to find the best configuration of decisional variables for the presented problem, the GRASP solver only relies on local search and, thus, there is no guarantee that the solution found is the global minimum.
