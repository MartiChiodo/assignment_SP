Repository for the _Numerical Optimization for Large Scale Problems_  (Politecnico di Torino, AY 2024/2025). The assignment, inspired by the IHTC 2024 competition, focuses on implementing a stochastic optimizer to create efficient hospital schedules. The solution uses a local search algorithm based on neighborhoods to explore possible scheduling improvements.
